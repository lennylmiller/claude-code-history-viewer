## Why this exists

Claude Code stores conversation history in JSONL files scattered across `~/.claude/projects/`. These are hard to read and search through. This app gives you a proper interface to browse your conversations, see usage stats, and find old discussions.

## Screenshots & Demo

### Main Interface

Browse projects and view conversations with syntax-highlighted code blocks

## What it does

**Browse conversations**: Navigate through projects and sessions with a file tree on the left, conversation view on the right.

**Search and filter**: Find specific conversations or messages across your entire history.

**Usage analytics**: See which projects you use most, token usage over time, and activity patterns. Useful for understanding your Claude Code habits.

**Better reading experience**: Syntax highlighted code blocks, properly formatted diffs, and readable message threads instead of raw JSONL.

**Tool output visualization**: Web search results, git operations, and terminal output are displayed in a readable format.

The app also handles large conversation histories without freezing up, and auto-refreshes when new conversations are added.

## Installation

### Download

Get the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/jhlee0409/claude-code-history-viewer/releases).

### Build from source

**🌍 Language Support**: The app includes **complete English language support** by default, with additional support for Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhlee0409/claude-code-history-viewer.git
cd claude-code-history-viewer
# Run the setup script to install all dependencies
./scripts/setup-build-env.sh
# Build the application
pnpm tauri:build
```

#### Manual Setup

##### macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhlee0409/claude-code-history-viewer.git
cd claude-code-history-viewer
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Add required Rust targets for universal builds
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
# Build
pnpm tauri:build
```

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+, pnpm, Rust toolchain, Xcode Command Line Tools

##### Linux
See [LINUX_BUILD.md](LINUX_BUILD.md) for detailed Linux build instructions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhlee0409/claude-code-history-viewer.git
cd claude-code-history-viewer
pnpm install
pnpm tauri:build:linux
```

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+, pnpm, Rust toolchain, system libraries (WebKit, GTK)

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. It automatically scans `~/.claude` for conversation data
3. Browse projects in the left sidebar
4. Click any session to view messages
5. Check the analytics tab for usage insights

## Current limitations

- **Linux and macOS support** (Windows support planned)
- **Beta software** - expect some rough edges
- Large conversation histories (thousands of messages) might be slow to load initially
- Auto-update system is still being tested

## Data privacy

Everything runs locally. No data is sent to any servers. The app only reads files from your `~/.claude` directory.

## Claude directory structure

The app expects this structure:

```
~/.claude/
├── projects/          # Project conversations
│   └── [project-name]/
│       └── *.jsonl    # Conversation files
├── ide/              # IDE data
├── statsig/          # Analytics
└── todos/            # Todo lists
```

## Troubleshooting

**"No Claude data found"**: Make sure you've used Claude Code and have some conversation history. Check that `~/.claude` exists.

**Performance issues**: Try closing other apps if you have very large conversation histories. The app loads everything into memory for now.

**Update problems**: Beta auto-updater might be flaky. Download manually from releases if needed.
